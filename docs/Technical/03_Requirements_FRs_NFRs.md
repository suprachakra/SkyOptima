## Requirements: Functional (FRs) and Non-Functional (NFRs)

### Functional Requirements (FRs)
| FR ID | Requirement                                               | Acceptance Criteria                                                           | Priority | Risks & Mitigation                                        |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| FR-01 | Ingest data from internal booking and revenue systems     | Data is successfully extracted, validated, and loaded into the data lake      | High     | Data inconsistency; use schema validation and deduplication |
| FR-02 | Integrate external data feeds (competitor pricing, weather) | Real-time and batch ingestion complete; external data aligns with internal data | High     | Data delays; implement fallback mechanisms                |
| FR-03 | Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering        | Features are generated, and anomalies are detected, with documentation logs   | High     | Incorrect transformations; use automated tests             |
| FR-04 | Forecast demand using multiple models                     | Forecast models provide RMSE/MAPE below defined thresholds                    | High     | Model drift; schedule regular retraining                   |
| FR-05 | Implement a dynamic pricing engine using RL               | Prices update in real time based on demand; reaction time < 2 minutes          | High     | Unpredictable pricing; use guard rails and simulations       |
| FR-06 | Provide APIs for internal and legacy system integration     | APIs return accurate data and enable seamless integration                     | Medium   | API failures; include automated monitoring                 |
| FR-07 | Generate interactive dashboards for real-time monitoring    | Dashboards display KPIs with updates every 5 minutes                          | High     | Latency issues; optimize data pipelines                    |

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
| NFR ID | Requirement                                               | Metric/Threshold                         | Priority | Risks & Mitigation                                      |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| NFR-01 | System Uptime                                             | ≥ 99.99%                                 | High     | Downtime; implement auto-scaling and redundancy          |
| NFR-02 | Data Latency                                              | ≤ 5 seconds for real-time data updates   | High     | High load; optimize streaming and processing frameworks  |
| NFR-03 | Scalability                                               | Must support global operations           | High     | Scalability bottlenecks; design with microservices       |
| NFR-04 | Security                                                  | 0 critical vulnerabilities, full encryption | High  | Data breaches; continuous security audits              |
| NFR-05 | Regulatory Compliance                                     | Fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA, aviation standards | High | Legal risks; maintain updated compliance documentation  |
| NFR-06 | Maintainability                                           | Codebase modularity, > 90% test coverage   | Medium   | Technical debt; enforce code reviews and automated testing|
| NFR-07 | User Experience                                           | Positive user feedback, usability score ≥ 90% | Medium  | Poor UX; conduct regular usability testing               |
