## Infrastructure Guide
SkyOptimaâ€™s infrastructure is designed to be robust, scalable, and secure, leveraging cloud-native architectures and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for automated provisioning and management.

### Key Components

### 1. Cloud Architecture
- **Cloud Platforms:**  
  - Utilizes major cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) for global scalability.
- **IaC:**  
  - Terraform and CloudFormation scripts automate resource provisioning.
  - Configurations include compute instances, storage, networking, and load balancers.

### 2. Containerization and Orchestration
- **Docker:**  
  - All services are containerized using Docker.
- **Kubernetes:**  
  - Kubernetes is used for orchestration, ensuring auto-scaling, load balancing, and self-healing capabilities.
- **Service Mesh:**  
  - (Optional) Implement Istio for advanced traffic management and security between microservices.

### 3. High Availability and Disaster Recovery
- **Geo-Redundancy:**  
  - Deployments across multiple regions ensure global availability.
- **Auto-Scaling:**  
  - Infrastructure automatically scales based on load metrics.
- **Disaster Recovery:**  
  - Detailed backup plans and disaster recovery strategies are in place to maintain 99.99% uptime.

### 4. Monitoring and Logging
- **Centralized Logging:**  
  - Logs are aggregated using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for real-time analysis.
- **Performance Monitoring:**  
  - Integration with Prometheus and Grafana for continuous system health monitoring.

## Summary
This document details the infrastructure architecture, emphasizing scalability, high availability, and secure operations. The use of IaC and container orchestration ensures a resilient environment ready for global deployment.
