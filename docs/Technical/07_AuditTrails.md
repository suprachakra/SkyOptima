## Audit Trails
Audit trails are critical for maintaining transparency, ensuring regulatory compliance, and facilitating troubleshooting. This document describes how SkyOptima tracks changes, logs activities, and maintains data provenance.

### Logging Framework
- **Centralized Logging:**  
  - All system logs are aggregated in a centralized logging system (ELK stack).
- **Activity Logging:**  
  - Every data transformation, model update, pricing decision, and API interaction is logged with detailed metadata.
- **Access Logs:**  
  - Comprehensive logs for user access and system interactions to monitor potential security incidents.

### Audit Processes
- **Regular Audits:**  
  - Scheduled internal audits review logs and system changes.
- **Compliance Checks:**  
  - Audit trails ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and aviation-specific regulations.
- **Traceability:**  
  - Every change in the system is traceable to its source (code commit, configuration change, or manual intervention).

### Tools and Integration
- **Audit Logging Module:**  
  - Implemented in **src/logging/audit_logging.py** to capture and store logs.
- **Monitoring Dashboards:**  
  - Real-time dashboards display key audit metrics and alert on anomalies.

### Summary
This document details the robust audit trail mechanisms that provide transparency, traceability, and regulatory compliance for the entire SkyOptima system.
