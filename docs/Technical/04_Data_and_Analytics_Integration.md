## Data and Analytics Integration

### Data Ingestion
- **Internal Data:**- Extract booking, revenue, and occupancy data from airline systems.
- **External Data:** - Ingest competitor pricing, weather, event calendars, economic indicators, and social sentiment.
- **Mechanisms:**  
  - Dual-mode ingestion (batch and real-time streaming) with automated fallback mechanisms.
  - Use Apache Kafka for streaming and Apache Airflow for orchestration of batch processes.

### Data Processing & Transformation
- **ETL Pipelines:**  
  - Automated pipelines perform data cleaning, normalization, and deduplication.
  - Data is enriched with external sources and validated through anomaly detection algorithms.
- **Data Governance:**  
  - Strict schema validation, data fusion, and provenance tracking ensure data quality and integrity.

### Analytics Integration
- **Feature Engineering:**- Transform raw data into predictive features (lag variables, rolling averages, interaction terms).
- **Modeling:**- Use advanced ML models for forecasting demand and optimizing pricing.
- **Real-Time Dashboards:**- Integrate with BI tools (Tableau, Power BI) for real-time visualization of KPIs.
- **Monitoring:**- Continuous monitoring and alerting mechanisms track data flows, model performance, and operational metrics.

#### Summary
This document outlines how data from diverse sources is ingested, processed, and integrated into the analytics stack, ensuring high-quality insights and enabling robust predictive modeling.
