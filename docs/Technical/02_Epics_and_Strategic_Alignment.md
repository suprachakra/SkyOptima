## Epics and Strategic Alignment
This document outlines the major EPICs for SkyOptima and demonstrates how each aligns with our strategic objectives and OKRs.

| EPIC                                | Description                                                                                                    | Key Features                                                                                           | Strategic Alignment                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **EPIC 1: Data Integration and Governance** | Establish robust ETL pipelines that ingest, cleanse, and validate both historical and real-time data.             | Dual-mode ingestion (batch & streaming), automated schema validation, anomaly detection, data fusion.   | Supports OKR-1 (Enhance Forecast Accuracy) and OKR-3 (Ensure Scalability and Resilience). |
| **EPIC 2: Advanced Forecasting and Modeling** | Develop and deploy a suite of predictive models including ARIMA, LSTM/GRU, and ensemble methods for demand forecasting. | Deep learning models, continuous retraining, integration of causal models, hyperparameter tuning.         | Addresses OKR-1 (Forecast Accuracy) and OKR-2 (Optimize Revenue).                        |
| **EPIC 3: Dynamic Pricing Engine**   | Create a dynamic pricing module leveraging reinforcement learning and optimization algorithms to adjust fares in real time. | Real-time pricing adjustments, EMSR-based seat allocation, adaptive RL integration, overbooking policies. | Supports OKR-2 (Optimize Revenue) and OKR-4 (Cross-Functional Integration).              |
| **EPIC 4: Scalability and System Integration** | Build a microservices-based architecture ensuring global scalability, seamless legacy integration, and high availability. | Containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), robust API integrations, geo-redundancy, auto-scaling.             | Aligns with OKR-3 (Global Scalability) and OKR-4 (Integrated Cross-Functional Collaboration). |
| **EPIC 5: Monitoring, Security, and Compliance** | Implement comprehensive monitoring, security, and compliance frameworks to safeguard data and ensure regulatory adherence. | Real-time dashboards, multi-tier alert systems, end-to-end encryption, detailed audit trails, compliance reporting. | Directly supports OKR-5 (Security and Compliance) and enhances overall operational resilience. |
| **EPIC 6: Continuous Improvement and Innovation** | Establish mechanisms for continuous feedback, change management, and the incorporation of emerging technologies.       | Agile feedback loops, CAB reviews, edge computing pilot, blockchain integration exploration.             | Supports OKR-4 (Cross-Functional Collaboration) and ensures future-proofing of the system.  |

### Summary
Each EPIC is carefully designed to meet specific strategic objectives, ensuring that every facet of the system—from data integration and forecasting to dynamic pricing, scalability, and security—is fully integrated and aligned with our business goals.
