  Establish robust ETL pipelines that ingest, cleanse, and validate both historical and real-time data.
- **Key Features:**  
  - Dual-mode data ingestion (batch and streaming)
  - Automated schema validation and anomaly detection
  - Data fusion from multiple sources
- **Strategic Alignment:**  
  Supports OKR-1 (Enhance Forecast Accuracy) and OKR-3 (Ensure Scalability and Resilience).

### EPIC 2: Advanced Forecasting and Modeling
- **Description:**  
  Develop and deploy a suite of predictive models including ARIMA, LSTM/GRU, and ensemble methods to accurately forecast demand.
- **Key Features:**  
  - Implementation of deep learning and ensemble techniques
  - Continuous retraining and hyperparameter tuning
  - Integration of causal and time-series models
- **Strategic Alignment:**  
  Directly addresses OKR-1 (Forecast Accuracy) and OKR-2 (Optimize Revenue).

### EPIC 3: Dynamic Pricing Engine
- **Description:**  
  Create a dynamic pricing module that leverages reinforcement learning and optimization algorithms to adjust fares in real time.
- **Key Features:**  
  - Real-time pricing adjustments based on demand elasticity
  - EMSR-based seat allocation and overbooking policies
  - Adaptive reinforcement learning for continuous improvement
- **Strategic Alignment:**  
  Supports OKR-2 (Optimize Revenue) and OKR-4 (Cross-Functional Integration).

### EPIC 4: Scalability and System Integration
- **Description:**  
  Build a microservices-based architecture that ensures global scalability, seamless integration with legacy systems, and high availability.
- **Key Features:**  
  - Containerization (Docker/Kubernetes)
  - Robust API integrations for internal and external systems
  - Geo-redundant and auto-scaling infrastructure
- **Strategic Alignment:**  
  Aligns with OKR-3 (Global Scalability) and OKR-4 (Integrated Cross-Functional Collaboration).

### EPIC 5: Monitoring, Security, and Compliance
- **Description:**  
  Implement comprehensive monitoring, security, and compliance frameworks to safeguard data and ensure regulatory adherence.
- **Key Features:**  
  - Real-time dashboards and multi-tier alert systems
  - End-to-end encryption, MFA, and regular security audits
  - Detailed audit trails and compliance reporting
- **Strategic Alignment:**  
  Directly supports OKR-5 (Security and Compliance) and underpins overall operational resilience.

### EPIC 6: Continuous Improvement and Innovation
- **Description:**  
  Establish mechanisms for continuous feedback, change management, and the incorporation of emerging technologies.
- **Key Features:**  
  - Agile feedback loops and iterative improvements
  - Change management processes and CAB reviews
  - Exploration of edge computing and blockchain integration
- **Strategic Alignment:**  
  Supports OKR-4 (Cross-Functional Collaboration) and ensures the system remains future-proof.

## Summary
Each EPIC is carefully designed to address specific strategic goals while ensuring that all aspects of the system—from data ingestion to dynamic pricing—are fully integrated and aligned with our business objectives.
