## DevOps Pipeline and Deployment

SkyOptimaâ€™s DevOps strategy is built to ensure rapid, reliable, and continuous delivery of high-quality code. This document details the CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and deployment procedures.

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Version Control:**  
  - Git-based repository for source code management.
- **Automated Testing:**  
  - Every commit triggers unit, integration, performance, and security tests.
- **Build and Deployment:**  
  - Docker is used for containerization.
  - Kubernetes orchestrates deployment across multiple environments.
- **Pipeline Tools:**  
  - Utilizes Jenkins/GitLab CI/CD for automation.
  - Rollback mechanisms and blue/green deployment strategies are implemented for safe updates.

### Deployment Strategy
- **Staging Environment:**  
  - Changes are first deployed in a staging environment for user acceptance testing (UAT).
- **Production Rollout:**  
  - Gradual rollout using canary releases or blue/green deployments.
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Continuous monitoring and automated alerts ensure immediate detection of issues post-deployment.

### Documentation and Governance
- **Deployment Scripts:**  
  - All deployment steps are automated and documented in the CI/CD pipeline configuration.
- **Change Management:**  
  - All changes undergo rigorous code reviews and impact assessments before deployment.

### Summary
This document outlines the DevOps pipeline and deployment strategy that ensures seamless, automated, and safe releases. Continuous testing, monitoring, and rapid rollback capabilities guarantee a stable production environment.
