## Risk Management Framework

### Identified Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                | Impact                                                | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Inconsistency**              | Reduced forecast accuracy and unreliable insights     | - Enforce strict ETL validations<br>- Implement cross-source comparisons and anomaly detection algorithms              |
| **Model Drift/Degradation**         | Decrease in predictive performance                     | - Schedule continuous retraining<br>- Use rolling cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning                           |
| **System Downtime/Performance Bottlenecks** | Loss of revenue and operational inefficiencies        | - Deploy auto-scaling, load balancing, and geo-redundant architectures<br>- Conduct extensive performance and stress testing |
| **Security Breaches**               | Data loss, compliance violations, reputational damage  | - Perform regular security audits and penetration testing<br>- Enforce encryption, MFA, and strict access controls       |
| **Legacy Integration Challenges**   | Disruptions in data flow and operational inefficiencies  | - Develop robust legacy adapters with clear data mapping<br>- Implement incremental integration with testing              |
| **Market Volatility**               | Unpredictable revenue fluctuations                     | - Use adaptive reinforcement learning models<br>- Implement risk guard rails and fallback pricing strategies              |
| **Regulatory Non-Compliance**       | Legal penalties and operational shutdowns              | - Maintain updated compliance documentation<br>- Schedule regular compliance audits and internal reviews                 |
| **User Adoption Issues**            | Underutilization of system capabilities                | - Conduct regular UAT sessions<br>- Incorporate continuous feedback loops and iterative UI/UX improvements               |

## Governance Structure

- **Executive Steering Committee:**  
  - Composed of senior leaders from Product, Engineering, Data, Marketing, and Operations.
  - Reviews strategic progress, risk registers, and compliance reports quarterly.

- **Technical Review Board:**  
  - A cross-functional team responsible for code reviews, architecture validations, and integration testing.
  - Meets bi-weekly to discuss technical issues and propose improvements.

- **Compliance and Audit Team:**  
  - Responsible for ongoing security audits, vulnerability assessments, and compliance checks.
  - Provides monthly reports on risk metrics and remediation actions.

- **Change Management Board:**  
  - Evaluates proposed changes to the system, ensuring minimal disruption and clear communication.
  - Approves changes based on impact analysis and stakeholder feedback.

## Monitoring and Reporting
- **Real-Time Dashboards:** - Integrated monitoring dashboards track key metrics (forecast accuracy, system uptime, security incidents).
- **Automated Alerting:** - Multi-tier alert systems notify teams immediately upon detecting anomalies.
- **Regular Audits:** - Scheduled internal and external audits validate governance and risk management processes.
