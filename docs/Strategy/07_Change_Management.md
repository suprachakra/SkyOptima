## Change Management
Change Management is crucial to ensure that SkyOptima remains agile and continuously improves while maintaining stability and regulatory compliance. This document outlines our comprehensive change management process designed to preemptively identify, assess, and implement changes without compromising system integrity.

### Change Management Process

#### 1. **Change Identification**
- **Sources of Change:**
  - **Internal Feedback:** Suggestions from product teams, user acceptance testing, and operational reviews.
  - **Market/Regulatory Trends:** Changes in market conditions, competitor activities, or new regulatory requirements.
  - **Technological Advances:** Integration of emerging technologies such as edge computing or blockchain.
- **Documentation:**  
  - All change requests are logged in a centralized Change Management Register with details on impact, urgency, and requester.

#### 2. **Impact Assessment**
- **Risk Analysis:**
  - Evaluate potential risks using our Risk Management Framework.
  - Assess the impact on performance, security, compliance, and user experience.
- **Stakeholder Review:**
  - Cross-functional teams (Product, Engineering, QA, Data, Ops, and Security) review the change request.
  - A Change Impact Report is generated, highlighting trade-offs and dependencies.

#### 3. **Approval Process**
- **Change Advisory Board (CAB):**
  - A dedicated board reviews high-impact changes.
  - CAB meetings are held weekly to review pending changes and provide recommendations.
- **Criteria for Approval:**
  - Minimal disruption to existing operations.
  - Clear benefits that outweigh risks.
  - Alignment with strategic objectives and compliance requirements.

#### 4. **Implementation**
- **Development & Testing:**
  - Changes are developed in a separate branch and undergo rigorous unit, integration, and regression testing.
  - Continuous integration pipelines ensure that new changes pass all automated tests.
- **Pilot Deployment:**
  - Changes are first deployed in a staging environment for user acceptance testing (UAT) and performance validation.
- **Full Rollout:**
  - Upon successful UAT and final CAB approval, changes are rolled out across production using blue/green deployments or canary releases.

#### 5. **Post-Implementation Review**
- **Monitoring & Feedback:**
  - Real-time dashboards track the performance of the change.
  - Feedback is collected from end-users and cross-functional teams.
- **Documentation & Audit:**
  - All changes, test results, and user feedback are documented.
  - Post-implementation reviews are conducted to validate success and update risk registers accordingly.

### Communication Plan
- **Internal Communication:**
  - Regular updates are shared via internal newsletters, dedicated Slack channels, and bi-weekly cross-functional meetings.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:**
  - Key stakeholders receive detailed change briefs and impact reports.
  - Training sessions and updated user guides are provided when necessary.

## Continuous Improvement
- The change management process is reviewed quarterly to incorporate lessons learned.
- Metrics such as change success rate, mean time to recovery (MTTR), and stakeholder satisfaction are tracked to drive improvements.
