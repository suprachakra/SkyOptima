### Additional Considerations
- **Agile & SAFe Alignment:** Regular PI planning and sprint retrospectives ensure cross-functional alignment and continuous improvement.
- **Risk Management:** Each phase includes explicit risk identification and corresponding mitigation strategies.
- **Outcome Focus:** Every sprint is measured against clear success metrics and deliverables, ensuring accountability and strategic alignment.
