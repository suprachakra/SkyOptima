## DevOps Guidelines
These guidelines define best practices for continuous integration, deployment, and overall system maintenance for SkyOptima.

### CI/CD Practices
- **Automated Testing:**- Every code commit triggers unit, integration, performance, and security tests.
- **Version Control:**- Git is used with a branching strategy (feature branches, develop, main).
- **Code Reviews:**- Mandatory peer reviews for every code change.
- **Deployment Strategy:**- Utilize blue/green or canary deployments to minimize production risks.
- **Rollback Mechanisms:**- Automated rollback procedures are in place in the CI/CD pipelines.

### Operational Procedures
