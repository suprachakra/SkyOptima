## Legacy Integration Documentation
This document describes the integration of legacy airline systems with SkyOptima. Our goal is to ensure seamless data exchange and maintain operational continuity.

### Key Considerations
- **Data Mapping:**- Identify legacy data formats and map them to the standardized schema.
- **Error Handling:**- Implement robust error handling in the adapter to capture data inconsistencies.
- **Testing:** - Conduct extensive testing with historical legacy data to validate the mappings.
- **Performance:** - Optimize the adapter for low latency to support near real-time processing.

### Implementation Details
- **Legacy Adapter Module:**  
  - Written in Python, it converts legacy booking records into the SkyOptima schema.
  - Utilizes detailed logging to record any mapping issues.

### Future Enhancements
- Automate data extraction from legacy systems.
- Expand the adapter to support additional legacy modules beyond bookings.
