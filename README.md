  - Built with containerized microservices (Docker/Kubernetes) and automated CI/CD pipelines for global scalability and high availability.
  - Supports real-time streaming (Apache Kafka/Spark Streaming) and edge computing to reduce latency.

- **Comprehensive Monitoring & Operational Excellence:**  
  - Features interactive dashboards, multi-tiered alerting systems, and extensive automated testing (unit, integration, performance, and security).
  - Includes detailed runbooks, disaster recovery plans, and operational best practices for smooth, resilient operations.

- **Cross-Functional Integration & Agile Alignment:**  
  - Seamlessly integrates with legacy systems and internal platforms via robust APIs.
  - Supported by comprehensive documentation, including strategic planning (OKRs, roadmaps, brand guidelines) and technical guides (architecture, design, DevOps, security, release management).

### Purpose
